## Use US International Keyboard in Omarchy

If you need accents in your keyboard input, but have the layout set to US, do this:

Go to your input settings:

`SUPER + ALT + SPACE >> Setup >> Input`

Change two config variables to:

```
kb_layout = us 
kb_variant = intl # International Layout 
```

You are all set!
